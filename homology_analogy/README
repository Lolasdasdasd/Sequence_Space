This folder contains additional code and data for the classification into homologous and analogous relationships.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* relationship_counts.csv
  raw counts of classified relationships (relationships) into (Analogous) (Unassigned) and (HH_Homologs)
  homologous relationships were additionally checked if they come from the same X-group (same_X) or even from the same H-group (same_XH)
  The threshold used for assigning homology or structured domains to fragments is indicated in (Prob) which is either 50% or 90%
  for each combination of sets of fragments (batch1 and batch2) three independent calculations were done (alignment)
  
* sample_sizes.csv
  list of how many 100-mers were considered in each of the 10 derived sets
